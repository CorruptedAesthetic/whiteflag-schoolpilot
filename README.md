# Whiteflag School Pilot 

## Introduction

[Whiteflag](https://whiteflagprotocol.org/) is a fully neutral and secure
communciations protocol based on blockchain technology. It enables near
real-time communication in conflict and disaster areas to exchange early
warning and status information to create shared situational awareness.
The [Whiteflag Protocol specification](https://standard.whiteflagprotocol.org/)
is an open standard.

This Whiteflag pilot is to build a so called [Minimum Viable Product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/minimum_viable_product)
(MVP) to communicate the location of schools.

## Planning

The project is currently in planning. More details will follow soon.
